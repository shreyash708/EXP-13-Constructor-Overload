# Experiment 13 – Constructor Overloading in C++
Student: Shreyash Sonar
PRN: 24070123164
Batch: B3

# AIM: To study and implement Constructors and Destructors

# THEORY:
•	The name of the constructor is same as its class name. 
•	Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though it can be declared in the private section of the class. 
•	Constructors do not return values; hence they do not have a return type. 
•	 A constructor gets called automatically when we create the object of the class. 
•	Constructors are used when variables need to be initiated before object is called.
•	Constructors can be overloaded. 
•	Constructor cannot be declared virtual

# Experiment 13B – Constructor Overloading (Practical - Temperature Conversion)
Start the program.
Create a class Temperature with a float data member for Celsius.
Define three constructors:
Default constructor: Set Celsius to 0.0.
Parameterized constructor: Accept a Celsius value from the user.
Copy constructor: Copy Celsius value from another object.
Create a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and display both.
Create three objects using different constructors.
Call the display function for all objects.
End the program.

# Conclusion
Constructor overloading helps create objects in different ways.
Real-world applications like temperature conversion show practical uses of overloading.
