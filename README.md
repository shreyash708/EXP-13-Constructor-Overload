# Experiment 13 – Constructor Overloading in C++

# AIM: To study and implement Constructors and Destructors

# THEORY:
•	•	In C++, We can have more than one constructor in a class with same name, as long as each has a different list of arguments. 
This concept is known as Constructor Overloading and is quite similar to function overloading. 
•	Overloaded constructors essentially have the same name (exact name of the class) and different by number and type of arguments.
•	A constructor is called depending upon the number and type of arguments passed.
•	While creating the object, arguments must be passed to let compiler know, which constructor needs to be called. 


# Experiment 13B – Constructor Overloading (Practical - Temperature Conversion)
Start the program.
Create a class Temperature with a float data member for Celsius.
Define three constructors:
Default constructor: Set Celsius to 0.0.
Parameterized constructor: Accept a Celsius value from the user.
Copy constructor: Copy Celsius value from another object.
Create a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and display both.
Create three objects using different constructors.
Call the display function for all objects.
End the program.

# Conclusion
Constructor overloading helps create objects in different ways.
Real-world applications like temperature conversion show practical uses of overloading.
